test on writing an mmo interface in angular

## Branching strategy

Things will be auto pushed to D when a merge request is approved on the dev branch.
Code will be auto pushed to T when a merge request into the T branch is approved
For every feature a dedicated branch will be created. When the feature is ready, a merge request into the Dev branch is made.
Only when merged into Dev, can an feature start to be deployed.
